# Three.js-Population-Api

1. Run `node index.js`
2. Go to localhost:3000

This program allows users to visualize the population of a given country using a population API and Three.js.  Links are below: 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/country-api
https://threejs.org/

The program gets the population data from the api, and sends it to the client to be processed.  From there it creates mini characters on the planet representing how populated that country is.  

Minimum number of people: 0
Maximum number of people: 200
